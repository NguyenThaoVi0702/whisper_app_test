There was an issue loading URL from $audio value

Things to look out for:

URL is valid
URL scheme matches the service scheme, i.e. https and https
The static server has wide-open CORS, more on that here
Technical description: HTTP error status: 0
URL: /tasks/1/resolve/?fileuri=czM6Ly9saGwtczMtYTU0NC1haXBhZ2UtYmJoL2hpc3QtYXVkaW8vbGFiZWxpbmctZGF0YS8xMjA2IEhvcCBjb25nIGRvYW5fMC53YXY=
